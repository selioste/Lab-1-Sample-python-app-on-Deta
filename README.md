# Sample Python app on Deta

This work is the result of the first TP of Digital Traces. It was for us to create a sample python app on Deta.
The implementation of this app can be summarized in 4 parts:
- Creation of a small python application with Flask
- Versioning of the code with github
- Deployment of the app with Deta
- Track of the application usage using google analytics
